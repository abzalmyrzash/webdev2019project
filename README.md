JonedIn is a social media. A pretty basic and simple social media, nothing extraordinary here.
* It consists of users, groups, posts and comments.
* A user can either post to a group or their own profile.
* Each post and comment can be upvoted or downvoted. The post (comment) score equals to # of upvotes minus # of downvotes.
* Each user has a reputation score. It equals the sum of scores of all posts and comments that the user has posted.
* Post and comments can be sorted by new, old, top, or hot.
  - Sorting by new will display *the most recent* posts first.
  - Sorting by old, on the other hand, will display *the oldest* posts first.
  - Sorting by top will display the posts *with the biggest scores* first.
  - Sorting by hot will display the posts first *depending on the algorithm*. (Generally, *recent* posts *with a big score* will be displayed first. Between two posts that have same score, *the newest* of them will be chosen to appear first)
